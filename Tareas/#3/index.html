				<h3>Tools nedeed.</h3>
				<h5>Here mention which tool need you, beginning to the more important and finally with the optional tools.</h5>
				<h4>1. <u>Screwdriver:</u></h4>
			</hgroup>
			<p>This is the most important tool because in the process you could find many cross screws and flat screws. For a screwdriver the size goes by number. You'll need these.</p>
			<ul>

				<ol>Phillip Screwdriver #4</ol>
				<ol>Flat Screwdriver    #4</ol>
				<ol>Phillip Screwdriver #1 (Optional)</ol>
				<ol>Flat Screwdriver	#2 (Optional)</ol>
			</ul>
			<hgroup>
				<h4>2. <u>Needle-nose pliers (can cut wires):</u></h4>
			</hgroup>
			<p>With this tool you can grab, hold, pull and cut some pieces including wires and the guitar strings.</p>
			<hgroup>
				<h4>3. <u>Ruler:</u></h4>

			<hgroup>
				<h4>4. <u>Hex Key Set or/and Truss Rod Wrench:</u></h4>
			</hgroup>
			<p>Is important have a hex key set because some parts in the guitar used this kind of key. In case of the truss rod wrench first look your truss rod type, if your guitar has this kind of truss rod is fundamental buy the truss rod wrench, this in case if you don't have wrench because in most cases the guitar come with the truss rod wrench.</p>
			<hgroup>
				<h4>5. <u>Adjustable spanner or wrench set:</u></h4>
			</hgroup>
			<p>Any two option works.</p>
			<hgroup>
				<h4>6. <u>Oil for sewing machine or any lubricant for a metal parts:</u></h4>
